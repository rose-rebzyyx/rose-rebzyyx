We're such a mess together...

I think I need your help, I think she's coming back

You're the only one who's making me come


To my sinful senses


I'll never love, anyone the same


Am I naïve to think that he could be the love of my life?


There is a voice inside my head that's tellin' me that it's right


I never thought I'd tell him how scared I am of losing him


...

Someday we'll both be older


I wonder if we'll be together looking back on the past


But I don't care if I don't live to see another day


I love you in the worst way



I love you and I hate you and I'm losing my mind


And you tell me all the time that this will pass and that I'm gonna be fine


We're such a mess together, you make me lose my temper
